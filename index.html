                        The ring can move on its own. It can control or let the bearer control the wearers of the other rings that were already corrupted by Sauron's power.<br>
                        The ring also corrupt's the bearer.<br>
                        The bearer is invisible when wearing the ring and is also basically immortal but he is slowly tuning permanently invisible.
