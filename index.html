                        The ring can move on its own. It can control or let the bearer control the wearers of the other rings that were already corrupted by Sauron's power.<br>
                        The ring also corrupt's the bearer.<br>
                        The bearer is invisible when wearing the ring and is also basically immortal but he is slowly tuning permanently invisible.

                        But since it has its own will the wearer would have had to have a really strong will to be able to throw it in without help.

                        The ring was lost after it revealed Isildur to his enemies and which led to his death and after Sméagol also known as Gollum found it, killed his cousin
                        and hid in the Misty Mountains.<br> The ring was found after nearly 500 years when it tried to escape and Bilbo Baggings found it.

                        When Bilbo took it he used it to escape the mountains and complete his journey.<br>
                        He had the ring for 60 years and used it without knowing what it actually was and that is did more than just make him invisible.<br>
                        When Gandalf the Grey fount out what it was he warned Bilbo against using it more than necessary.
