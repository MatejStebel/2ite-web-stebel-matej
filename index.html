                        The one ring is a powerful ring created by Sauron
                        to help him control the other rings and the ones that wore them.

                        He forged it in Mount Doom in Mordor.<br> When he created it he put a greater part
                        of his power and will into the ring and it gained a will of its own.

                        The ring can move on its own. It can control or let the bearer control the wearers of the other rings that were already corrupted by Sauron's power.<br>
                        The ring also corrupt's the bearer.<br>
                        The bearer is invisible when wearing the ring and is also basically immortal but he is slowly tuning permanently invisible.

                        If someone strong enough wore it he wold have been corrupted and turned into the new Dark lord.<br>
                        It is also nearly indestructible, the only thing in the Middle Earth that can destroy it are the fires of Mount Doom.<br>
                        But since it has its own will the wearer would have had to have a really strong will to be able to throw it in without help.

                        The ring was lost after it revealed Isildur to his enemies and which led to his death and after Sméagol also known as Gollum found it, killed his cousin
                        and hid in the Misty Mountains.<br> The ring was found after nearly 500 years when it tried to escape and Bilbo Baggings found it.
